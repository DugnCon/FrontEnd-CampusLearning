## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in CampusLearning, please help us by reporting it responsibly.

1. **Do not** open a public issue. Instead, send an email to **quyen.nd19@outlook.com** with:
   * A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   * Steps to reproduce (proof of concept).
   * Any potential impact you have identified.
2. We will acknowledge your report within **3 business days** and keep you updated on the status.
3. After the issue is resolved, we will credit you (if you wish) in the release notes.

## Security Update Process

• We create a dedicated private branch to fix the vulnerability.
• After internal review and testing, we publish a security release.
• Release notes will describe the vulnerability class, severity, and mitigation guidance, but will not disclose exploit details until a majority of users have updated.

Thank you for helping keep CampusLearning and our users safe!
